(* ConstructiveWorld-Main - the rational sample certificates of the
   maximum-modulus growth closed forms. *)

(** * GaC2_11_MaxModulusDisk_cert: gain and radius samples.

    Mission.  Node C2-11 (segment C2, slot W2), certificate piece.
      The rational-level mirrors of the growth-lemma closed forms and
      their vm_compute sample points: [cert_tau] (the gain-scale
      [tau = s0 s1 / (s0 + (R/4) s1)]), [cert_theta] (the adaptive
      theta factor [tau / (4 sqT r4)]), [cert_rho] (the adaptive
      radius [theta / (1 + theta) scaled by R/4]), and [cert_gain]
      (the gain increment [(1/2) rho tau]).  Sample lemmas at the
      unit instance [s0 = s1 = sqT = R = 1]: [tau = 4/5],
      [theta = 4/5], [rho = 1/9], [gain = 47/45], the radius
      modulus face [rho^2 = 1/81], and the radius bound
      [rho < 1/2].  The chain-walk step-count certificate belongs
      to the chain interface premise of the node statement piece
      and is not carried here.

    Dependencies.  Stdlib [QArith.QArith].  Requires
      [S02_CauchyComplete] ([QeqT], [QltT]) of this development.

    References.  drafts_C2.md C2.11 certificate note (the gain
      constant and step-bound samples); the closed forms are the
      rational mirrors of the statement-piece growth direction.

    Constructivity.  All statements are Set-sorted rational
      decisions ([QeqT], [QltT]); every proof closes by
      [vm_compute]; zero assumed constants.

    Build.  [coqc -native-compiler no -q -Q <certified vo tree> ""
      -Q <build dir> "" GaC2_11_MaxModulusDisk_cert.v] from the flat
      build directory, thermal guard wrapper. *)
