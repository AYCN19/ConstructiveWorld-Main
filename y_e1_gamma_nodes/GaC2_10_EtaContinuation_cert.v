(** * GaC2_10_EtaContinuation_cert: certificate face of node C2-10.

    Mission.  Certificate face of node C2-10: the decidable rational
    sample bands of the L13 obligation row (drafts_C2.md C2.10, the
    certificate row sigma0 in {1/2, 1}).  Bands: (1) the eta
    uniform-modulus weight corridor [GaC2_10_w1_form] - the explicit
    1 + 2 * q form over the rational inputs, sampled at the sigma0 = 1
    slot closing exactly at 2 (the rational two-power 2^{-1} = 1/2)
    and at the sigma0 = 1/2 slot closing at the rational corridor 5/2
    (the irrational 2^{-1/2} enters through its rational upper face
    3/4, underpinned by the square band 2 >= (4/3)^2 = 16/9); (2) the
    denominator lower-bound sample band on the real axis (the L13
    local-constant registration): the s = 1/2 sample
    ([GaC2_10_cert_lb_s1_2]: sqrt(2) > 7/5 gives |1 - 2^(1/2)| > 2/5;
    [GaC2_10_cert_lb_sq_s1_2]: the squared form 3 - 2 sqrt(2) > 1/6
    from sqrt(2) < 17/12), and the s = 3/2 sample
    ([GaC2_10_cert_lb_sq_s3_2]: the squared form 3/2 - sqrt(2) > 1/12
    from the same square band).  Honest scope (fail-loud): these bands
    certify the rational corridor forms and the decidable skeleton
    only; the Real-line bound faces live on the statement face with
    the premise family, the s = 1 point is a denominator zero (the
    zero-set face of C2-09) so no sample is claimed there, and the
    irrationals enter only through their rational square-band
    certificates.

    Dependencies.  Stdlib [QArith.QArith] only (the face is
    base-standalone: the proof-to-cert direction stays one-way, no
    statement-face require).

    References.  drafts_C2.md C2.10 certificate line (the denominator
    lower-bound sample band, the sigma0 in {1/2, 1} two samples); the
    card C2.10 row (c) (the weight corridor 1 + 2 * 2^{-sigma0});
    gamma_module_spec.md section 4.2 the certificate-face shape
    (literal certificates, the compute-closed verification lemmas).

    Constructivity.  Set-sorted rational identities and boolean
    skeletons; zero assumed constants, zero abandoned proofs; the
    bands close by the compute tactic under the global context.

    Build.  [coqc -native-compiler no -q -Q . ""
    GaC2_10_EtaContinuation_cert.v] from the flat build directory; the
    face is base-standalone (Stdlib only) so the lane is free of the
    mother-chain condition. *)
